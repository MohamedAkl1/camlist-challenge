A simple service for adding pets and placing bids on them and then determining the winner of the bids.

# Requirements

- `yarn` or `npm`

# Installation

# Running

`yarn start` / `npm start` will start the application at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (set environment variable `PORT`
to change the port).

# Testing

Tests can be run with `yarn test` / `npm test`. A `watch` mode is configured for

All tests are colocated with their respective source files in `*.spec.js` files,
using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with default settings.
